## user stories
I decided to try to use each one of the Acceptence Criteria to create a user story; I found that since the first two relate to virtually the same thing; I could apply the DRY principle here and let the second user story reflect not the act of depositing but the other pieces of information that go along with the deposit. I also extended the scope to "transactions" so this user story can refer to withdrawals too. \
Also it became apparent tht the last two lines refer to the same action; so I have four user stories.

```
As a client
So that I can store my money
I'd like to be able to deposit into my account

As a client
So that I can track my money
I'd like my transactions to have a date/timestamp and a record of the amount

As a client
So that I can spend some money
I'd like to be able to withdraw from my account

As a client
So that I can keep a record of my finances
I'd like to be able to print a statement with details of all my transactions
```
